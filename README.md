## m files 
### These m files created by matlab are mainly about machine learning classification，including MAP, LDA, logistic regression function, SVM(linear and gaussian)， EM and so on. The file named compare compared the accuracy between MAP, LDA, and logistic regression function. Besides, based on classifican method mentioned above, I realized image color classification.
## py files
### These py files mainly constructed convolutional neural network and trained signal input and image input based on Tensoorflow and Keras. The files named neural network and neural network used data generated by matlab to construct neural network, used 10-fold cross-validation and compared the performance between different optimize function and other parameter.
