## m files 
### These m files created by matlab are mainly about machine learning classificationï¼Œincluding MAP, LDA, logistic function, SVM(linear and gaussian) and so on. The file named compare compared the accuracy between MAP, LDA, and logistic function. Besides, based on classifican method mentioned above, I realized image color classification. The files named data generation generated data for the cnn in the py file.
## py file
### These py files mainly constructed convolutional neural network and trained signal input and image input. The files named neural network and neural network constructed neural network, used 10-fold cross-validation and compared the performance between different optimize function and other parameter.
